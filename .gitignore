# File names that match the patterns in this file will not be tracked by git
# unless explicitly you explicitly force git to track a file using `git add -f`.

# This .gitignore file at the root of the repository should be used for types
# of files and common build output that should be excluded from source control.

# For specific files that should be ignored, add the file name to a .gitignore
# file in the file's directory (instead of adding the file to this
# .gitignore in the repository root).
# When using TortoiseGit to ingore a specific file, select these options:
#   Ignore Type: Ignore item(s) only in the containing folder(s)
#   Ignore File: .gitingore in the containing directories of the items

# Most of the ignore patterns in this file are a refined list from the default
# .gitignore that "GitHub for Windows" creates when initializing a new repository.
